# This is a visualisation of different famous search algorithms (and a bad one of my own)

# Update as of January 2023

## Changes and improvements ideas

### Overhaul of the user interface

**Not intuititive to use the spacebar to add walls** : Add functionality to add walls by clicking & draging left mouse button

**Currently can not remove walls**: Add functionality to remove walls by clicking on existing walls

**Remove the moving algorithm selector and update UI** : Replace it with a stationary configurations tab

**Snapping type animation when moving around the start and end node** : Would allow the user to see where they will drop the start/end node before letting go of the mouse button

### Allow for other configurations

- Individual square/node size (WON'T DO)
- Grid size (N x M squares) (WON'T DO)
- [ ] Allow toggle between euclidian and manhattan distance (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] Colour scheme (high contrast for accesibility) (LOW PRIORITY)

### Pathfinding algorithms to add

- [ ] Breadth-first search (will find shortest path)
- [ ] A\* search (will find shortest path)
- [ ] Djikstra's search - (will find shortest path) **NOTE** : Exact same as BFS in an unweighted graph
- [ ] Greedy best-first search - (will find a path)
