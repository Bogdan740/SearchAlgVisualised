# This is a visualisation of different famous search algorithms (and a bad one of my own)

# Update as of January 2023

## Changes and improvements ideas

### Snapping type animation when moving around the start and end nodes [ ]

Would allow the user to see where they will drop the start/end node before letting go of the mouse button

### Overhaul of the user interface [ ]

**Not intuititive to use the spacebar to add walls** : Add functionality to add walls by clicking & draging left mouse button

**Currently can not remove walls**: Add functionality to remove walls by clicking on existing walls

### Remove the moving algorithm selector [ ]

Replace it with a header bar where an algorithm can be selected

### Allow for other configurations [ ]

- [ ] Colour scheme (high contrast for accesibility)
- [ ] Individual square/node size
- [ ] Grid size (N x M squares)
- [ ] Allow toggle between euclidian and manhattan distance
